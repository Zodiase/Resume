# My Resume

My resume under (version) control. I'm getting tired of maintaining multiple copies of it...

## Usage

There should be a Github Page containing the published version of the app (once it's done).
Printing the page with **no margin** should yield the exact result as shown on screen (minus the extra controls and interaction effects).

## Motivation

I almost lost track of which copy of my multiple resumes is the most up-to-date. What's worse? They all seemed to have out-dated info. As a programmer, maintaining multiple copies of the same data to me is a big no no! So how about throwing everything into one JSON file and using an app to pick and render whatever I (or other readers) need? Sounds pretty good, right?

## Version

This project uses Semantic Versioning. The patch version is incremented for superficial changes such as styling and content correction. The minor version is incremented for content additions or feature additions and the changes must not remove any existing content or feature. The major version is incremented for breaking changes where content or feature must be altered or removed.
